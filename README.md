# Robotics Assignment

A Docker stack containing `ROS1`, `ROS2` and a `Bridge` container, which can connect, communicate and control a [TURTLEBOT 2](http://kobuki.yujinrobot.com/about2), over a local WiFi network.

        B[ROS1] <---> |Bridge| D[ROS2]
        D[ROS2] <---> E[Planner]
    end
```

Since the Physical robot's dated software can only run `ROS1`, we set up a `ROS1` container that can listen and talk to the robot, the `ROS1` container sends the information it receives to `ROS2` over a Bridge, which allows bidirectional communication between `ROS1` and `ROS2`.

The procedure of finding people and following the first recognized person:

## How to run

Make sure you have [docker & docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed

Run `docker-compose up` (might take a while on your first run, my last fresh install took me 50 minutes ðŸ™ƒ)

Three containers should be created within a stack, with the following names:

- `assignment-ros1-1`
- `assignment-ros2-1`
- `assignment-bridge-1`

## Troubleshooting

If you want to shell into a particular container for debugging purposes, you can run the following command:

`docker exec -it [container-name] bash`

E.g.

`docker exec -it assignment-ros1-1 bash`

You may run into an issue where you cannot access the ROS CLI. In that case you should source the setup file

In ROS2: `source install/setup.bash`

In ROS1: `source devel/setup.bash`

(You shouldn't have to do this in the ROS1 container)

## Controlling the Robot via SSH

First shell:

`roslaunch kobuki_node minimal.launch --screen`

Second shell:

`roslaunch kobuki_keyop safe_keyop.launch --screen`

Third shell:

`roslaunch astra_launch astra.launch`

Fourth shell:

`rqt_image_view`

Fifth shell (just for debugging):
`roslaunch pub_sub_testing pub_sub_testing.launch`

# Notes

Ros1 is a listener on another topic for only the robot is subscribed to

Topic on the robot to listen for controls made by a controller
